=======================

Some starter code that shows how to use [`ebpf-tools`](https://github.com/kfl/ebpf-tools).

Using [`ebpf-tools`](https://github.com/kfl/ebpf-tools) is currently a
bit gnarly, because it isn't released to Hackage yet. Thus, you must
have to make a `cabal.project` file as demonstrated in this project.
